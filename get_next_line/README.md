<p>The <strong>get_next_line</strong> project involves implementing a function in C that reads a single line of text from a file or standard input with each call. The goal of this project is to learn how to work with files, manage dynamic memory, and manipulate pointers in the C language.</p>

<p>The <code>get_next_line</code> function reads a file line by line, regardless of the length of the line or the size of the file. Each call returns the next line, and the operation ends when the entire file has been processed or when the end of the file (EOF) is encountered.<br/>Returned <strong>line</strong> has to be freed.</p>

<p>Key aspects of the project include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Buffer usage</strong>: The function operates with a buffer of a defined size (BUFFER_SIZE), which determines the amount of data read from the file at one time.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory management</strong>: The project requires efficient dynamic memory management to correctly store the remaining data for the next function call after each read operation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>get_next_line</strong> project helps deepen understanding of memory management, file operations, and implementing algorithms that efficiently handle dynamic data in C.</p>
