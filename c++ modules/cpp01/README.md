# C++ Module 01

## About the Project

**C++ Module 01** is the second module in the series of C++ projects, focusing on memory management, pointers, references, and control structures like the `switch` statement. This module provides a deeper understanding of how memory is allocated and managed in C++, alongside the practical use of pointers and references.

During this project, I expanded my knowledge of C++ by working on more complex scenarios, implementing multiple classes, and understanding how to efficiently manage memory while avoiding leaks.

## Main Goals of the Project

1. **Memory Management**
   - Allocating memory dynamically using `new`.
   - Deleting dynamically allocated memory to avoid leaks.

2. **Pointers and References**
   - Understanding the use of pointers to members.
   - Using references as an alternative to pointers where applicable.

3. **Control Structures**
   - Mastering the `switch` statement.
   - Writing cleaner and more structured code.

4. **Class Design**
   - Implementing classes with proper encapsulation.
   - Designing modular and reusable code.

## What I Learned

1. **Memory Allocation**
   - Allocating and deallocating memory using `new` and `delete`.
   - Managing arrays of objects with dynamic allocation.

2. **Pointers and References**
   - Understanding the difference between pointers and references.
   - Using pointers to member functions to avoid repetitive code structures.

3. **Class Implementation**
   - Designing constructors and destructors to properly manage resources.
   - Ensuring no memory leaks occur by correctly cleaning up allocated memory.

4. **Error Handling**
   - Handling unexpected inputs and errors gracefully.
   - Writing tests to ensure robustness and correctness.

5. **Using the `switch` Statement**
   - Implementing efficient decision-making processes.
   - Reducing the complexity of conditional branching.

## Downloading the Project

To download the project to your computer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git`:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>
   cd <repository_folder_name>
   ```

2. Navigate to the appropriate subfolder (e.g., `ex00`, `ex01`, ..., `ex06`) to check a specific task.

## How to Test the Project

Each task is located in a separate folder (`ex00`, `ex01`, ..., `ex06`) and is independent of the others. To test a task, follow these steps:

### Running the Program:
1. Navigate to the folder of the specific task, e.g.:
   ```bash
   cd ex00
   ```

2. Use the `Makefile` to compile the program:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. After compilation, run the program, e.g.:
   ```bash
   ./program_name <arguments>
   ```

### Cleaning Files:
To remove object files and the executable, use:
```bash
make clean
```

To also remove files generated by the `Makefile`, use:
```bash
make fclean
```

### Other Tasks:
Repeat the above steps for the folders `ex01` to `ex06` to test the respective programs:
- **ex00**: `BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ` - Implementing and managing a simple Zombie class.
- **ex01**: `Moar brainz!` - Creating and managing a horde of Zombies with dynamic memory allocation.
- **ex02**: `HI THIS IS BRAIN` - Exploring pointers and references.
- **ex03**: `Unnecessary violence` - Designing classes with proper encapsulation and relationships.
- **ex04**: `Sed is for losers` - Replacing substrings in files without using `std::string::replace`.
- **ex05**: `Harl 2.0` - Using pointers to member functions for decision-making.
- **ex06**: `Harl filter` - Filtering logs using the `switch` statement.

## Summary

C++ Module 01 significantly deepens the understanding of C++ by focusing on memory management and pointers, which are essential for effective C++ programming. This module also introduces best practices for class design and control structures, providing a solid foundation for more advanced topics in future modules.
