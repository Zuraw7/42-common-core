# C++ Module 02

## About the Project

**C++ Module 02** focuses on advanced concepts of C++ such as ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the Orthodox Canonical Class Form.

This project helped me refine my object-oriented programming skills, while also introducing advanced concepts like polymorphism and operator customization.

## Main Goals of the Project

1. **Orthodox Canonical Form**
   - Designing classes with default constructors, copy constructors, copy assignment operators, and destructors.

2. **Fixed-Point Numbers**
   - Implementing a fixed-point number class to manage numbers with fractional parts.
   - Balancing precision and performance in numerical representations.

3. **Operator Overloading**
   - Overloading arithmetic, comparison, and increment/decrement operators.
   - Making custom classes behave like built-in types.

4. **Ad-hoc Polymorphism**
   - Using function overloading and static member functions.
   - Creating reusable and flexible functions.

## What I Learned

1. **Orthodox Canonical Class Form**
   - Designing classes with proper constructors, assignment operators, and destructors.

2. **Operator Overloading**
   - Overloading operators to implement arithmetic, comparison, and other behaviors.
   - Using operator overloading to make classes intuitive and user-friendly.

3. **Fixed-Point Arithmetic**
   - Understanding the trade-offs between floating-point and fixed-point numbers.
   - Implementing a fixed-point class to represent fractional numbers precisely.

4. **Advanced Class Design**
   - Managing private and static members effectively.
   - Designing modular, maintainable, and reusable class structures.

5. **Geometric Problem Solving**
   - Using custom classes (like `Point`) to solve geometric problems.
   - Implementing algorithms like BSP (Binary Space Partitioning) to check if a point lies inside a triangle.

## Downloading the Project

To download the project to your computer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git`:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>
   cd <repository_folder_name>
   ```

2. Navigate to the appropriate subfolder (`ex00`, `ex01`, `ex02`, `ex03`) to check a specific task.

---

## How to Test the Project

Each task is located in a separate folder (`ex00`, `ex01`, `ex02`, `ex03`) and is independent of the others. To test a task, follow these steps:

### Running the Program:
1. Navigate to the folder of the specific task, e.g.:
   ```bash
   cd ex00
   ```

2. Use the `Makefile` to compile the program:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. After compilation, run the program, e.g.:
   ```bash
   ./program_name <arguments>
   ```

### Cleaning Files:
To remove object files and the executable, use:
```bash
make clean
```

To also remove files generated by the `Makefile`, use:
```bash
make fclean
```

### Other Tasks:
Repeat the above steps for the folders `ex01` to `ex03` to test the respective programs:
- **ex00**: `My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form` - Implementing a fixed-point number class.
- **ex01**: `Towards a More Useful Fixed-Point Number Class` - Extending the class with integer and float conversions.
- **ex02**: `Now We’re Talking` - Adding operator overloading and min/max static functions.
- **ex03**: `BSP` - Determining whether a point lies inside a triangle using a custom algorithm.

## Summary

C++ Module 02 builds upon previous modules by introducing more advanced concepts of object-oriented programming and class design. This module’s focus on fixed-point arithmetic, operator overloading, and ad-hoc polymorphism lays a strong foundation for creating more complex and user-friendly C++ applications in the future.
