# C++ Module 04

## About the Project

**C++ Module 04** delves into the advanced features of object-oriented programming, focusing on subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. The module's exercises help solidify understanding of how these concepts allow for flexible and extensible software design.

## Main Goals of the Project

1. **Polymorphism**
   - Understanding and implementing runtime polymorphism through virtual functions.

2. **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**
   - Designing abstract base classes and using them to enforce common behavior in derived classes.

3. **Dynamic Memory Management**
   - Managing resources effectively to avoid memory leaks, especially in complex inheritance scenarios.

4. **Deep Copies**
   - Ensuring proper handling of deep copies to manage dynamic resources safely and avoid shallow copy issues.

## What I Learned

1. **Subtype Polymorphism**
   - Leveraging runtime polymorphism for flexible and reusable code.

2. **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**
   - Using abstract classes and pure virtual functions to enforce consistent behavior in derived classes.

3. **Dynamic Memory Management**
   - Proper allocation, deallocation, and deep copying of dynamic resources to avoid memory leaks.
  
4. **Advanced OOP Design**
   - Designing complex systems using interfaces and abstract classes to decouple components and improve modularity.

5. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Writing comprehensive tests to ensure functionality and memory safety.

## Downloading the Project

To download the project to your computer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git`:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>
   cd <repository_folder_name>
   ```

2. Navigate to the appropriate subfolder (`ex00`, `ex01`, `ex02`, `ex03`) to check a specific task.

## How to Test the Project

Each task is located in a separate folder (`ex00`, `ex01`, `ex02`, `ex03`) and is independent of the others. To test a task, follow these steps:

### Running the Program:
1. Navigate to the folder of the specific task, e.g.:
   ```bash
   cd ex00
   ```

2. Use the `Makefile` to compile the program:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. After compilation, run the program, e.g.:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

### Cleaning Files:
To remove object files and the executable, use:
```bash
make clean
```

To also remove files generated by the `Makefile`, use:
```bash
make fclean
```

### Other Tasks:
Repeat the above steps for the folders `ex01` to `ex03` to test the respective programs:
- **ex00**: `Polymorphism` - Introduction to runtime polymorphism with an `Animal` base class and its derived classes `Dog` and `Cat`. Includes a demonstration of proper and improper polymorphism with the `WrongAnimal` and `WrongCat` classes.
- **ex01**: `I donâ€™t want to set the world on fire` - Enhancing `Dog` and `Cat` classes with dynamic memory management by introducing a `Brain` class. Demonstrates deep copying, proper destructor chaining, and testing with an array of polymorphic `Animal` objects.
- **ex02**: `Abstract Class` - Refactoring `Animal` into an abstract class by marking `makeSound()` as a pure virtual function. Ensures derived classes (`Dog` and `Cat`) implement the required behavior while preventing instantiation of the `Animal` base class.
- **ex03**: `Interface & Recap` - A comprehensive exercise implementing interfaces (`ICharacter`, `IMateriaSource`) and an abstract `AMateria` base class. Demonstrates advanced polymorphism, inventory management, and dynamic behavior through `MateriaSource` and `Character` implementations.

## Summary

C++ Module 04 builds on the foundational concepts of object-oriented programming by introducing subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. These exercises emphasize the importance of dynamic behavior, modularity, and robust memory management in C++ development, providing a strong foundation for more advanced programming challenges.
