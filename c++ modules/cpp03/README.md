# C++ Module 03

## About the Project

**C++ Module 03** introduces the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming, allowing to extend and reuse functionality from base classes. The exercises are desgined to deepen understanding of inheritance and explore the benefits of code reuse and organization in C++.

## Main Goals of the Project

1. **Inheritance**
   - Creating derived classes and reusing functionality from base classes.
   - Understanding and implementing proper construction and destruction chaining.

2. **Orthodox Canonical Form**
   - Following the canonical class structure to ensure consistent and maintainable code.

3. **Polimorphism**
   - Overriding member functions in derived classes to provide specialized behavior.

## What I Learned

1. **Inheritance Basics**
   - Reusing and extending functionality from base classes.
   - Properly managing base and derived class construction/destruction.

2. **Code Reusability**
   - Using inheritance to reduce duplication and streamline code organization.

3. **Dynamic Behavior**
   - Overriding member functions to provide specific functionality in derived classes.

## Downloading the Project

To download the project to your computer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git`:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>
   cd <repository_folder_name>
   ```

2. Navigate to the appropriate subfolder (`ex00`, `ex01`, `ex02`) to check a specific task.

## How to Test the Project

Each task is located in a separate folder (`ex00`, `ex01`, `ex02`) and is independent of the others. To test a task, follow these steps:

### Running the Program:
1. Navigate to the folder of the specific task, e.g.:
   ```bash
   cd ex00
   ```

2. Use the `Makefile` to compile the program:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. After compilation, run the program, e.g.:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

### Cleaning Files:
To remove object files and the executable, use:
```bash
make clean
```

To also remove files generated by the `Makefile`, use:
```bash
make fclean
```

### Other Tasks:
Repeat the above steps for the folders `ex01` to `ex02` to test the respective programs:
- **ex00**: `ClapTrap` - Basic implementation of a robot class with attack, repair, and damage mechanics.
- **ex01**: `ScavTrap` - Extending ClapTrap with additional functionality and attributes.
- **ex02**: `FragTrap` - Another ClapTrap derivative with unique behaviors and attributes.

## Summary

C++ Module 03 builds a strong foundation in object-oriented programming with a focus on inheritance and class design. These exercises teach how to create reusable and extendable code while adhering to good coding practices.
