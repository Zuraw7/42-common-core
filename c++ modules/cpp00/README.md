# C++ Module 00

## About the Project

**C++ Module 00** is the first module in a series of projects introducing the C++ programming language. Its purpose is to introduce the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and to understand key elements of the language, such as classes, member functions, namespaces, initialization lists, static attributes, and constants.

During this project, I gained practical experience in applying basic C++ constructs and transitioned from a procedural to an object-oriented approach.

## Main Goals of the Project

1. **C++ Basics**
   - Classes and member functions.
   - Namespaces and input/output streams.
   - Static attributes and constants.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming**
   - Creating classes and object instances.
   - Data encapsulation and access to fields and methods (public, private).

3. **Memory Management**
   - Using `new` and `delete`.
   - Avoiding memory leaks.

4. **Writing Readable Code**
   - Organizing files (`.hpp` and `.cpp`).
   - Clear and tidy code that facilitates collaboration.

## What I Learned

1. **C++ Programming Basics**
   - Working with namespaces and standard streams (`std::cout`, `std::cin`).
   - Formatting text and output using `iomanip`.

2. **Creating Classes and Object-Oriented Programming**
   - Designing classes in a clear and modular way.
   - Using appropriate private and public attributes.

3. **Efficient Memory Management**
   - Understanding the differences between static and dynamic allocation.
   - Preventing memory leaks.

4. **Practical Debugging Skills**
   - Analyzing and fixing errors.
   - Writing code that adheres to the C++98 standard.

## Downloading the Project

To download the project to your computer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git`:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>
   cd <repository_folder_name>
   ```

2. Navigate to the appropriate subfolder (e.g., `ex00`, `ex01`, or `ex02`) to check a specific task.

## How to Test the Project

Each task is located in a separate folder (`ex00`, `ex01`, `ex02`) and is independent of the others. To test a task, follow these steps:

### Running the Program:
1. Navigate to the folder of the specific task, e.g.:
   ```bash
   cd ex00
   ```

2. Use the `Makefile` to compile the program:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. After compilation, run the program, e.g.:
   ```bash
   ./megaphone "Hello, World!"
   ```

### Cleaning Files:
To remove object files and the executable, use:
```bash
make clean
```

To also remove files generated by the `Makefile`, use:
```bash
make fclean
```

### Other Tasks:
Repeat the above steps for the folders `ex01` and `ex02` to test the respective programs:
- **ex01**: `My Awesome PhoneBook` - managing a phone book.
- **ex02**: `The Job Of Your Dreams` - recreating the missing `Account.cpp` file.

## Summary

C++ Module 00 is an excellent introduction to the C++ language and object-oriented programming. The project not only helped me understand the basics but also gave me confidence in applying a new programming paradigm. It is the foundation upon which I will build my knowledge in future modules and projects.
