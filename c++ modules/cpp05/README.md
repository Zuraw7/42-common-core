# C++ Module 05

## About the Project

**C++ Module 05** is the first module in a series of projects introducing the C++ programming language. Its purpose is to introduce the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and to understand key elements of the language, such as classes, member functions, namespaces, initialization lists, static attributes, and constants.

During this project, I gained practical experience in applying basic C++ constructs and transitioned from a procedural to an object-oriented approach.

## Main Goals of the Project

1. **Exception Handling**
   - Creating and throwing custom exception classes.
   - Using try/catch blocks to catch and manage errors.
   - Ensuring code stability with proper error handling mechanisms.

3. **Inheritance and Abstraction**
   - Designing an abstract base class (AForm) and specialized subclasses.
   - Applying polymorphism in form execution methods.
   - Structuring a flexible class hierarchy that can be easily extended..

5. **Orthodox Canonical Form**
   - Implementing constructors, destructors, and assignment operators in a consistent way.
   - Following best practices for class design and resource management.

6. **Clean Code and Organization**
   - Keeping header and source files well-organized.
   - Ensuring readability and maintainability through clear code separation.

## Downloading the Project

To download the project to your computer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git`:
```bash
   git clone <repository_link>
   cd <repository_folder_name>
```

2. Navigate to the appropriate subfolder (e.g., `ex00`, `ex01`, `ex02`, or `ex03`) to check a specific task.

## Summary

**C++ Module 05** delves deeper into object-oriented programming through advanced concepts like exception handling and inheritance. Building on previous modules, it strengthened my ability to design robust C++ applications. The knowledge and experience gained here form a solid foundation for tackling more complex challenges in future modules and projects.
