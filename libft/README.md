<p>The <strong>libft</strong> project at 42 Academy involves creating my own library of functions in the C language. The goal of this project is to write basic standard library functions from scratch, which allows me to gain a deeper understanding of their operation and the mechanisms behind them. This helps me learn efficient programming and low-level memory management.</p>

<p>During the project, I replicated functions from the following standard libraries:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>&lt;string.h&gt;</strong> &ndash; functions for manipulating strings.</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</strong> &ndash; general-purpose functions such as conversions and memory management.</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</strong> &ndash; functions for character classification and transformation.</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</strong> &ndash; system functions for input/output operations (in later stages).</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</strong> &ndash; basic input/output functions (in a limited scope).</li>
</ul>
