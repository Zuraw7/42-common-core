# NetPractice

## About the Project

**NetPractice** is an educational project aimed at developing skills related to the basics of computer networking. The project allows a deeper understanding of network protocols, IP address configuration, and packet routing.

While working on NetPractice, I learned how to design and configure networks by solving practical scenarios and network-related problems.

## Main Goals of the Project

1. **Understanding IP Addressing**
   - Classes of IPv4 addresses.
   - Subnet mask and CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing).
   - Subnet division.

2. **Packet Routing**
   - Creating static routes.
   - Analyzing routing tables.
   - Configuring default gateways.

3. **Troubleshooting Network Issues**
   - Identifying and fixing network configuration errors.
   - Simulating real-world network problem scenarios.

4. **Network Design**
   - Planning network architecture.
   - Optimizing routing for different topologies.

## What I Learned

During the NetPractice project, I gained the following skills and knowledge:

1. **Fundamentals of Computer Networking**
   - Understanding the operation of the network layer in the OSI model.
   - The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 (although the project mainly focused on IPv4).

2. **IP Addressing and Subnetting**
   - Calculating IP address ranges in different subnets.
   - Creating efficient IP addressing schemes for networks of varying sizes.

3. **Static Routing**
   - Configuring routes on network devices.
   - Analyzing routing tables to identify missing routes.

4. **Troubleshooting**
   - Debugging network errors.
   - Drawing conclusions based on logs and device configurations.

5. **Logical and Design Thinking**
   - Designing networks of varying complexity.
   - Finding the simplest solutions to complex problems.

## Summary

NetPractice is an excellent introduction to computer networking, combining theory with practice. The project not only develops technical skills but also teaches patience and logical thinking in the context of problem-solving.
