<p>The <strong>so_long</strong> project involved creating a simple 2D game in the C programming language using the <strong>MinilibX</strong> library. The goal of this project was to learn the basics of computer graphics, event handling, and memory management in interactive applications. Throughout the project, I learned how to create simple graphic elements such as the game map, the player character, and game mechanics like collecting items and moving across the map.</p>

<p>Key aspects of the <strong>so_long</strong> project included:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Map creation</strong>: The game map was created from a <code>.ber</code> file, where symbols represented different elements such as walls, empty spaces, the player's position, collectible items, and the exit.</li>
    <li><strong>2D graphics</strong>: Using MinilibX, I displayed map elements as 2D textures (sprites), which were drawn on the screen in their respective positions.</li>
    <li><strong>Event handling</strong>: I implemented keyboard input handling, which allowed the player to move across the map. When a key was pressed, the appropriate actions were assigned to move the character.</li>
    <li><strong>Enemy mechanics</strong>: I implemented a mechanic where enemies moved toward the player, and if the player touched an enemy, the game ended in defeat.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory management</strong>: A crucial part of the project was properly managing memory to avoid leaks during map loading and graphical operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>so_long</strong> project allowed me to gain experience in 2D graphics programming, user interaction, and writing efficient and well-optimized applications in the C language.</p>
